\begin{abstract}

This work investigates the application of Curriculum Learning in the context of SSL-EL robot soccer, focusing on improving the learning process in complex multi-agent environments. The proposed approach uses Reinforcement Learning as a foundation, implementing a curriculum system that decomposes complex tasks into simpler subtasks to enable gradual and progressive learning of agents. The developed methodology includes adapting the existing framework through the SSLCurriculumEnv class, which manages different levels of complexity in training, and the CurriculumCallback for monitoring and progression between levels. Preliminary results, obtained in 300 training steps, demonstrate that although the traditional method showed a slightly higher average reward (3.034 vs 2.813), Curriculum Learning showed signs of greater stability and potential for better long-term generalization, especially in the analysis of episode lengths and learning consistency.
